title: Looking for a permanent home
---

Local group, Make Monmouth are looking for a permanent place to call their home.

We're a group of people interested in working on projects ranging from robotics to the arts. 
The ideal space will be somewhere we can hold meetings, house our tools including a 3D printer and any in progress projects 
and we'd love to have access in the day and evenings. Close to the town centre is preferred but not essential.

We need:
- WiFi
- Electricity
- Heating

If you've got a space that fits the bill, please get in touch with Make Monmouth on <info@makemonmouth.co.uk> to discuss costs.
