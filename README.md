# Make Monmouth Website

This repository holds the code for the Make Monmouth website.

It uses Github Pages and Jekyll, and content is rendered using [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Local Development

To make changes to the site and test your changes, you'll want to follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

After you've done that, you'll want to run `bundle install` in this directory to install the dependencies.

Now [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) to work on (this gives you a "copy" of the code that you can make changes to without affecting anyone else).

Once you have everything installed, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the command line, and then visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a browser.

Any changes you make will automatically be reloaded and published.

Once you're happy with what you've written, follow the instructions to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and one of the website editors will get a notification that there's code for them to review.

Once your code has been reviewed, approved, and merged, it will appear on the website within a few minutes!
