Core Members are responsible for the day-to-day running of the group

{:.list-inline}
- Usually a director of the CIC
- Key holder with access to the space at all times ⃰
- Able to vote on ALL issues relating to management of the space and Make Monmouth CIC
- Prioritisation when it comes to requesting storage space such as shelves/cupboards to keep long-running projects
- First refusal for tickets to events and workshops organised by Make Monmouth

It is assumed that the Core Members will also be called upon to react in the event of an emergency, and take on additional duties when it comes to the running and management of both Make Monmouth CIC and the space itself.

As a result, this level of membership can only be granted in line within the legal framework of the company and cannot be subscribed to in the same way as the Full or Part-time membership
