title: Make Monmouth

Welcome to the website for Make Monmouth - we're a group set up by people who like to make stuff (from crafts to computers, 
robots to model railways).

We'll be updating this website at some point to make it a bit snazzier. In the meantime there's a [page asking for help finding a permanent page](./permanent-home) and [we have a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/744382199302587/).

While we're looking for a permanent home - we're having regular meetings every other Tuesday in Estero Lounge in Monmouth.
